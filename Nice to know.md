# Nice to know 

## Why twisted pairs ?
* The wires are twisted pairs because the problem with wires that aren’t twisted is that they generate
magnetic fields that interfere with the signal carried on the wire. This
means that you can get electromagnetic interference and crosstalk—
both of which are bad for your network data.
When the wires are twisted, the magnetic field around the wire is
effectively disrupted so that any interference is reduced. The more
twists there are in the pairs, the better.

## What is the difference between bandwidth and speed ?
*  Bandwidth is a capacity; speed is
a rate. Bandwidth tells you the maximum
amount of data that your network can
transmit. Speed tells you the rate at which
the data can travel.

## Mbps and MBps ? 
* Megabits per second (Mbps)
is a bandwidth rate used in the
telecommunications and computer
networking field. One megabit equals one
million bursts of electrical current (aka
binary pulses). Megabytes per second
(MBps) is a data transfer rate used in
computing. One megabyte equals 1, 048,
576 bytes, and one byte equals 8 binary
digits (aka bits).
