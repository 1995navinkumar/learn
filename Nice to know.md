# Nice to know 

## Why twisted pairs ?
* The wires are twisted pairs because the problem with wires that aren’t twisted is that they generate
magnetic fields that interfere with the signal carried on the wire. This
means that you can get electromagnetic interference and crosstalk—
both of which are bad for your network data.
When the wires are twisted, the magnetic field around the wire is
effectively disrupted so that any interference is reduced. The more
twists there are in the pairs, the better.

## What is the difference between bandwidth and speed ?
*  Bandwidth is a capacity; speed is
a rate. Bandwidth tells you the maximum
amount of data that your network can
transmit. Speed tells you the rate at which
the data can travel.

## Mbps and MBps ? 
* Megabits per second (Mbps)
is a bandwidth rate used in the
telecommunications and computer
networking field. One megabit equals one
million bursts of electrical current (aka
binary pulses). Megabytes per second
(MBps) is a data transfer rate used in
computing. One megabyte equals 1, 048,
576 bytes, and one byte equals 8 binary
digits (aka bits).

## Resistance
* Resistance is a measurement of how hard it is for electrons to
move through a wire. It’s measured in ohms, and represented by the
Greek letter omega, Ω. The higher the number of ohms, the harder
it is for electrons to move through the wire.
    * R = Pl/A (P = Resistivity of the material, l = length, A = area)

## Voltage
* Voltage is really electrical pressure.
*  voltage is the pressure that tries to make electrons flow.
It’s the push felt by the electrons. Think of voltage as the force that
moves the electrons in a circuit, and resistance as anything that might
slow them down, such as a broken wire.
* If we compare electron flow in a cable to water flow down a garden
hose, voltage is like the pressure of the water coming out the faucet,
and resistance is like the width of the garden hose.
* The signal on a network cable is just the change in voltage
over time.

## Noise
* Noise is unwanted signals on your network cables.
It comes from lots of different sources of electronic
energy. Most things that use electricity leak
electromagnetic energy. This is especially true of
electric things that move or have moving parts.
