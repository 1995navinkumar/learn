# Connecting Networks
*  The first thing you need is a working local area network (LAN).
Second, you need a connection to that other network. This
could be a Cat 5 cable or fiber or even a radio link. Finally,
you need a router to connect the 2 networks. The router
connects the networks physically as well as logically.
