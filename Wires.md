## CAT-5
* Known as Category 5 cable for Ethernet. It has an unshielded twisted pair of cable (UTP cable) and it takes a RJ-45 connector at either ends. 

## Cabling standards
* 568A and 568B are cabling standards that tell you which order your wires
need to go in when fitting an RJ-45 cable.

## Coaxial cable
* Just like CAT-5 cables, coaxial cables are used to create networks. There are
two key differences between them
* The cable contains one big copper wire rather than four
twisted pairs.A coaxial cable has a jacket on the outside, just like a CAT-5 cable. Inside
the cable, however, thereâ€™s just the one wire. It has a copper core or
conductor, with a layer of insulation made of plastic and other materials.
* The cables use different sorts of connectors and terminators.
CAT-5 cables use RJ-45 connectors. Coaxial cables, on the other hand, use
BNC connectors, T-connectors, and terminators. The sort of connector you
use depends on why you need it.
